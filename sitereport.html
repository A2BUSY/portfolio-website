                <h2>Scaffolding the project</h2>
                <p>
                    To set up the basic file structure of the project, I created each HTML page, with a tool called emmet that was preinstalled with VS code using <kbd>!</kbd> then <kbd>tab</kbd>. After that I created a css folder and put style.css into
                    it. I then created a sm.css for smaller devices, and a lg.css for large devices, and imported them from style.css if the device width was correct.
                </p>
                <h2>Creating the Navigation Bar</h2>
                <p>
                    My first step was to create the HTML for the bar. Originally the hamburger menu was a link, however this would not work when i clicked it. I did some research and decided to use a checkbox, as it would work the same. Then I used the :focus selector to
                    check if it was selected, and change the navbar display from none to flex. This means it would show when the checkbox was clicked. To style it like a hamburger menu, I used a pseudoelement and gave it content "â‰¡". I also made animation
                    on hover, using transition to slowly highlight, instead of instantly.
                </p>
                <h2>Creating the Index Name Animation</h2>
                <p>
                    First, I used a fading transition from a lighter purple, to a darker purple. This is still used in this page, under the class "text-highlight". Then I decided to use a 3D glitch effect, having inspiration from
                    <a href="https://codepen.io/cipherbeta/pen/YLdVjw">here</a>. To create a similar effect, I decided to use a ::before and ::after pseudoelement. I created animations to move them slightly towards the original word, so it will have a
                    cool seperating effect.
                </p>
                <h2>Where Design influences came from</h2>
                <p>
                    First, to generate the colors I used coolors.co, which is a website for generating color palettes quickly. To generate the pictures of my code, I found a website called https://carbon.now.sh/, which allowed me to create high quality screenshots
